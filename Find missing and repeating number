Find missing and repeating number

1. sort krke aa skta h O(nlogn)
2. bool present[];
traverse left to right
present[arr[i]]== true; if arr[i]==false;
and then traverse present array me dekho which one is false still


3. best method
n*n+1 / 2 = sum
sum of square = n(n+1)(2n+1)/6

Now let missing no=x and repeating be y

so by mathematically, Sum N - Sum arr  = x-y 
now  x2 - y2 = sum2n -sum2arr

matlb x+y * x-y = known bs nikaal lo
